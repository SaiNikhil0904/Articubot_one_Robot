# ArticuBot - Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance Robot 

## Overview

Welcome to ArticuBot, a demonstration project showcasing autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Developed as a software-only solution, ArticuBot utilizes ROS (Robot Operating System) and simulation tools to simulate a robot's movement in complex environments.

## Requirements

To run this demo successfully, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Ubuntu with ROS installed
- Gazebo simulator
- Necessary ROS packages for navigation and mapping

## Introduction

ArticuBot is a software-based project aimed at simulating the navigation and obstacle avoidance behavior of a robot in dynamic environments. This demo project provides insights into the implementation of ROS controllers, SLAM techniques, and path planning algorithms to achieve autonomous navigation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of ArticuBot is to showcase the feasibility and effectiveness of software-driven navigation and obstacle avoidance in robotics. By leveraging ROS and simulation tools, we aim to demonstrate how intelligent decision-making algorithms enable robots to navigate through complex environments while avoiding obstacles.

## Key Features

1. **ROS Integration:** Utilization of the Robot Operating System for seamless communication and control of the simulated robot.
2. **Gazebo Simulation:** Simulation of realistic environments using the Gazebo simulator to test and validate navigation algorithms.
3. **SLAM Techniques:** Implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for accurate mapping and localization.
4. **Path Planning:** Utilization of path planning algorithms to generate optimal paths for the robot to navigate.
5. **Autonomous Navigation:** Demonstration of autonomous navigation capabilities, allowing the robot to move to specified destinations while avoiding obstacles.
